        <p>Remember those books where the teenage wizards struggle against the Dark Lord of Evil? That movie where the
                              dwarves fight to recapture their mountain home from a dragon? That animated TV show about mystical knights and
                              their army of clones righting wrongs across the galaxy?</p>
        <p>Aren’t those
          <em>awesome</em>?</p>
        <p>Here’s your chance to put yourself in the heroes’ shoes in stories like those.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Fate Accelerated Edition</em>
          is a tabletop roleplaying game, where you and your friends gather around
                              and tell stories full of danger, excitement, and adventure. You might have played games similar to this
                              before—Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a very popular one—but don’t worry if you haven’t; this booklet will guide
                              you through it.</p>
        <p>Here’s what you’ll need to play:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Three to five people</strong>. One of you will be the
            <strong>gamemaster</strong>, the others
            <strong>players</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fate Dice™</strong>, at least four, preferably four per person. These are a special kind of
                                        six-sided dice that are marked on two sides with a plus symbol
            <span class="fate_font">+</span>, two sides
                                        with a minus symbol
            <span class="fate_font">-</span>, and two sides are blank
            <span class="fate_font">0</span>. You can get these dice from many hobby and game stores, often under their
                                        original name—Fudge dice. They are called Fate Dice on this site, but you can call them whatever you like.
                                        Evil Hat offers Fate Dice for sale at
            <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/">www.evilhat.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>If you don't want to use Fudge dice, you don't have to–any set of regular six-sided dice will work. If
                                    you're using regular dice, you read 5 or 6 as
            <span class="fate_font">+</span>, 1 or 2 as
            <span class="fate_font">-</span>, and 3 or 4 as
            <span class="fate_font">0</span>.</p>

            <strong>The Deck of Fate</strong>
            is an alternative to Fate Dice. It’s a deck of cards that mimics the
                                    probability of Fate Dice, and it’s designed to be used in the same way Fate Dice are. The Deck of Fate can
                                    be bought
            <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/deck-of-fate/">in the Evil Hat store</a>
            and there is also
            <a href="http://deckoffate.hiddenachievement.com/">an app</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Character sheets</strong>, one for each player. You can download these from
            <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/">www.evilhat.com</a>.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Index cards</strong>
            or
            <strong>sticky notes</strong>
            or similar slips of paper.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tokens for fate points.</strong>
            These can be poker chips, beads, pennies, or anything similar.
                                    Get a handful—about 30 or 40.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next, let’s talk about how to use Fate Accelerated to tell stories together.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Landon, Zird, and Cynere are breaking into a dockside warehouse in order to find smuggled goods on behalf of their latest employer. Unfortunately, someone tipped the smuggler off. Now Og, one of his thug lieutenants, is at the warehouse waiting for them to show up, and he brought along four friends.</p>

          <p>The participants in the conflict are pretty obvious—the
            <abbr title="Player Character">PC</abbr>s, plus Og and four nameless enforcers, all
            <abbr title="Nonplayer Character">NPC</abbr>s under Amanda’s control. The warehouse is the environment, and the group takes a moment to talk about it—boxes and crates everywhere, large and open, there’s probably a second floor, and Amanda mentions the loading door is open because they’re waiting for a ship to come in.</p>
